# Room Rate Management with Django(with

Create a Hotel Room Rate Management System using Django OR Django Rest
Framework (DRF), Python, and MySQL. The system should handle default rates,
overridden rates, discounts, and provide API endpoints to create, update, delete, and
display room rates. The system should also consider discount logic and show the
lowest rates based on room ID, date range, and available discounts.

1. Using DRF to develop CRUD API endpoints.
2. Using sqlite3 as db since I don't have public mysql instance
3. App is deployed using DockerFile available in the repo.
4. App is running in DEBUG mode to avoid login and auth flows
5. App is deployed in render.com instead of heroku due to account lock issue.

## App is Live at  https://django-hrms-api.onrender.com/swagger/
